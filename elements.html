									<h2>Currently working as a Freelance Consultant</h2>
									<p>In my role as a freelance consultant, I am responsible for several key areas of expertise.
										These include financial analysis and planning, where I provide valuable insights into forecasting,
										 budgeting, and financial health for businesses. I also specialize in data analysis and insights, 
										 working with large datasets and analytics tools to uncover trends and patterns that inform strategic decisions. As a strategic advisor, I can offer guidance on cost reduction, revenue enhancement, investment opportunities and risk management, based on financial and data analysis. Additionally, I have experience in creating customized financial models for various purposes, including valuation, scenario planning or investment analysis. Finally, I can assist businesses in creating performance reports and tracking key metrics and KPIs, while identifying opportunities for process optimization in financial operations and data management.
										 My company is still under process of getting registered.  <a href="http://WWW.InfinityAnalytics.ca">link</a>.</p>
